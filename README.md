There's a chance that you happen to be a recruiter so you probably ended up here because there was a link on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bart-le) or I could have written you [an email](mailto:le.bartlomiej@gmail.com) and you just clicked the Github logo either in the footer or the attached résumé.

Either way, I hope that you're having a great day!

## **ABOUT ME**
Hello there! I'm Bart.

By the end of 2018 I've decided to quit being a bartender. It's been really great years but changes come as time goes by. So what do I do? Well, use all my savings to enroll in a [coding boot camp](https://github.com/bart-le/frontend-basics/blob/master/certificate.pdf). To be honest, that was one of the craziest decisions I ever made. As I'm writing this, I have successfully completed the whole thing a month ago.

There's still so much to learn though, so I thought that after completing the course I'm going to go through the basics one more time to stay fresh. The best way to prove my knowledge would be by filling that tiled box with some of these little green squares.

>**TL;DR** I quit being a bartender, so I'm documenting my learning progress to change my career.
